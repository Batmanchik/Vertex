"""The nine legacy features, computed from RAW EVENTS.

Why this matters
----------------
The nine features the original model was trained on were written directly by
that model's own generator: it put ``gini = 0.67`` into a pyramid's row, and
the model read the answer instead of finding it. Its reported ROC-AUC of
0.993 therefore measured nothing at all, and no external validation was
structurally possible.

Computing the same nine from an independent event stream is what makes the
old model testable for the first time.

The first such run found it flagging none of thirty pyramids at its own
high-risk threshold. That result did not survive: two of the nine were coming
out as flat zeros because of defects in our generator, not in the model, and
once those were fixed the same model found forty of forty. The episode is
recorded in Finding 2 because measuring a model through a broken instrument
and blaming the model is a mistake worth not repeating.

The referral tree is inferred, not read
---------------------------------------
Two of the nine — ``referral_ratio`` and ``structural_depth`` — need to know
who recruited whom. The ground-truth file has that tree, and reading it would
be cheating. It is reconstructed from money instead: a depositor pays the
core, and shortly afterwards the core pays a percentage of that amount to
someone who is already a participant. That someone recruited them. This is
how a referral network is rebuilt from a bank statement in a real
investigation.
