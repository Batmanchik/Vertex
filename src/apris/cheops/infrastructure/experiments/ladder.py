"""E1 and E2 — the detector ladder, and whether the unit of analysis is what pays.

The question
------------
H1 says raising the unit of analysis from the account to the network buys
more than raising model complexity at the same unit. That is a comparison,
so it needs a grid rather than a number, and every cell has to be measured
the same way or the comparison is decoration.

The grid
--------
Four rungs of the ladder::

    rules       the published AFRD criteria, no fitting at all
    logistic    a linear model
    forest      a random forest
    boosting    gradient boosting

crossed with three scopes::

    account            one account per row, features of that account
    network_pooled     one discovered cluster per row, member features
                       averaged — the unit is raised and NOTHING else
    network_structural the same clusters, plus features that only exist
                       once there is a structure to measure

The middle scope is the whole point. Without it a gain from ``account`` to
``network_structural`` is ambiguous: it could be the unit, or it could be
five extra columns. ``network_pooled`` holds the feature kind fixed and moves
only the unit, so the two effects are separated instead of asserted.

What is fixed across every cell
-------------------------------
The same world, the same discovery output, the same purged walk-forward
splits, the same metrics. Models get no per-cell tuning, because a grid where
one cell was tuned and another was not measures the tuning.

The account scope cannot use the discovered clusters, so its rows are the
personal accounts of the world. Its base rate is therefore different, which
is why **average precision is reported beside ROC-AUC** — ROC-AUC is
insensitive to the base rate and would make the two scopes look comparable
in a way they are not.

Why the baseline counts two criteria and not three
--------------------------------------------------
The first full run, on 2026-09-05, put the rule baseline at ROC-AUC 0.9895 at
the network scope — above every fitted model. It was not a result. All of it
came from ``shared_device``, which fired on **100 % of fraudulent candidates
and 4.2 % of honest ones**, because discovery LINKS accounts by their shared
terminal in the first place. The criterion was reporting which of the three
link types had built the candidate, not whether the candidate was a ring. A
baseline flattered by the same circularity the case builder was rewritten to
remove is worse than one that flatters us, not better.

At the account scope the same criterion measured 0.000 on both classes over
25 539 accounts, for the unrelated reason that one account is not two people
sharing hardware. So it is unusable at either unit, and the score is taken
over ``listed`` + ``profile_deviation`` at both — which is also what makes
the H1 comparison legitimate: same rules, same columns, only the unit moves.
Every criterion is still evaluated and reported by ``rule_breakdown``; that
report is the evidence for the exclusion.

The second defect was in the list, not the criteria. Listing a structure had
required it to close within thirty days of its own start, and a candidate's
events run through its members' whole ordinary lives, so nothing ever closed
and ``listed`` measured 0.000 on both classes as well. The guard was trying
to say "only an investigated structure can be on a list", which the forward
ordering already says on its own.

What the run says, and what it does not
---------------------------------------
2026-09-05, seed 20261005, 90 mule networks, after the two baseline defects
above and the activity threshold in ``build_account_rows``::

    scope                model      ROC-AUC       AP    base rate
    account              rules       0.7573   0.4491        0.241
    account              logistic    0.9243   0.8552
    account              forest      0.9779   0.9504
    network_pooled       rules       0.6429   0.4465        0.358
    network_pooled       logistic    0.8135   0.6481
    network_pooled       forest      0.9705   0.9578
    network_structural   logistic    0.9314   0.8843        0.358
    network_structural   forest      0.9819   0.9708

Three readings, in order of how much weight they carry.

**Structure earns its place; pooling alone does not.** Raising the unit with
the feature kind held fixed is a small LOSS for the best model (0.9779 →
0.9705). Adding the columns that only exist once there is a structure turns
it into a small gain (→ 0.9819, AP 0.9504 → 0.9708) and a large one for the
linear model (0.8135 → 0.9314). So the value is in what a network lets you
MEASURE, not in the grouping by itself. H1 as originally worded — that the
unit matters more than the model — is not what this shows.

**The rules get worse at the network unit**, 0.7573 → 0.6429, because
``profile_deviation`` fires on 85.3 % of honest candidates: a cluster of
twenty people almost always holds one with a spike. A criterion written for
a person does not survive being pointed at a group.

**The strongest argument for the network unit is not in the table.** The
account unit cannot judge an account with no history, and 368 of 1 581 mules
never accumulate ten events of their own — **coverage 0.767**. Discovery
proposed 90 of 90 networks, coverage 1.000. Comparing 0.9779 with 0.9819 is
comparing two numbers computed over different populations; comparing 0.767
with 1.000 is comparing what each unit can see at all. The second comparison
is the honest one and it is the one to build on.

The differences between the fitted cells are small and rest on 148 network
rows from a single world. Before any of this is claimed, it needs repeating
across seeds with an interval, which is the next experiment and not this one.

The honest ceiling
------------------
Discovery does not propose every network, and a network never proposed cannot
be found by anything downstream. Coverage is carried into the report next to
the scores, so the network-scope numbers are read against their own ceiling
rather than against one.

    pyramid and a whip-round have senders. Against mules at a median of 33

    needs the scores themselves, so both callers go through the same walk and
    cannot drift into measuring different things.
