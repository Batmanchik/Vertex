"""External validation against the Elliptic Bitcoin dataset.

Why this exists
---------------
Every number this project produces comes from a simulator we wrote. Separating
events from features removed the crudest circularity, but what counts as
fraudulent behaviour is still our model of it. Only real labelled data opens
that circle, and Elliptic is the one public dataset that has all three
properties at once: real transactions, real fraud labels, and graph structure.

203 769 transaction nodes, 234 355 edges, 49 coarse time steps. About 46 000
nodes carry a label — roughly 4 500 illicit (ransomware, darknet markets,
Ponzi schemes) against 42 000 licit; the rest are unlabelled.

What transfers and what does not
--------------------------------
The transfer is partial, and pretending otherwise would be the same mistake
this project keeps finding in itself.

**Transfers.** Structural features. Elliptic is a payment graph, so density,
convergence, divergence and relay structure are all computable on a node's
neighbourhood.

**Does not transfer.** Two things, for concrete reasons rather than
convenience:

- *Amounts are not exposed.* The 165 columns are anonymised, so value-weighted
  variants are unavailable. Structural features are computed **unweighted**
  here — by edge count rather than by value — and the two are not the same
  quantity. A result on one is evidence about the other, not proof.
- *Time resolution is 49 coarse steps*, each covering roughly two weeks.
  Nothing in the sequence branch survives that: ``burst_ratio_90s`` cannot be
  evaluated on a series whose finest tick is a fortnight.

So this module tests one claim: **does relay structure carry signal on real
fraud data?** It cannot test the speed hypothesis, and it says so.

Data is downloaded on demand into ``data/elliptic`` and is git-ignored; the
features file alone is about 690 MB.
