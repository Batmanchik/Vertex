# Audit Findings, 2026-09-04

Status: measured, not estimated. Every number below was produced by running
the project's own code on its own artifacts.

These are recorded because they are **results**, not just defects. Each one
is defensible material for the scientific write-up, and each one would be
found by a technical reviewer who reads the source.

---

## Finding 1 — the three ML branches are one vector renamed three times

**Severity: critical. Status: addressed by `ml/event_features_v2.py`.**

`graph_v2.build_graph_matrix_from_tabular` and
`sequence_v2.build_sequence_matrix_from_tabular` build their matrices as
hand-written linear combinations of the same nine aggregate features:

```python
graph_density   = 0.05 + 0.95 * (0.38*central + 0.34*depth + 0.28*entropy_low)
burst_ratio_90s = 0.05 + 0.95 * (0.46*growth + 0.31*holding_short + 0.23*entropy_low)
_proxy_graph_prob = 0.36*central + 0.28*depth + 0.22*gini + 0.14*payout
```

Consequences:

1. **The graph branch never reads a graph; the sequence branch never reads a
   sequence.** Both are deterministic transformations of one vector, so
   fusing the three branches adds no information — the fusion input is a
   rank-deficient map of the tabular input.
2. **`burst_ratio_90s` promises a 90-second window** while being derived from
   `avg_holding_time`, which is measured in days. The name asserts a time
   resolution the input does not carry.
3. `fusion_v2` names its own functions `_proxy_sequence_prob` and
   `_proxy_graph_prob`, which is honest in the code and invisible in the
   architecture diagram.

This is the same defect class as the original `graph_module.py`, which drew a
transaction graph from the very features the graph was presented as
supporting — one architectural layer up and considerably more convincing.

**Fix.** `event_features_v2.py` computes both matrices from an actual event
stream. `burst_ratio_90s` now measures a real 90-second window by a
two-pointer scan.

### The feature that carries the structure

Degree alone cannot express a mule network. Measured means over four case
kinds, full-scale world:

| Feature | Crowd collection | **Mule network** | Payroll | Pyramid |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `graph_hub_share` (convergence) | 0.580 | 0.494 | 0.039 | 0.523 |
| `graph_fanout_share` (divergence) | 0.420 | 0.506 | 1.000 | 0.477 |
| **`graph_relay_share`** | **0.000** | **0.494** | **0.000** | **0.000** |
| `event_rate_hour` | 0.004 | 0.874 | 0.010 | 0.033 |
| `median_delta_inverse` | 0.019 | 0.954 | 0.137 | 0.084 |
| `burst_ratio_90s` | 0.023 | 0.230 | 0.012 | 0.002 |

`graph_relay_share` is the share of value relayed from a dominant source to a
*different* dominant sink through intermediaries — the textbook definition of
layering, encoded rather than fitted.

**A first attempt used the geometric mean of convergence and divergence and
failed**: a whip-round scored 0.492 against a mule network's 0.500, because
the collector is simultaneously the largest sender and the largest receiver.
Requiring `source != sink` and an actual two-hop path is what separates them.
Both the failure and the fix are pinned by tests.

## Finding 2 — WITHDRAWN, and why it was wrong

**Status: this finding does not reproduce. It was our defect, not the
model's, and the correction matters more than the original claim.**

### What was reported

The nine legacy features were computed from an independent event stream and
the model scored every pyramid near 0.50, flagging **none of thirty** at its
own high-risk threshold of 0.70. That was reported as a calibration failure:
perfect ranking, zero detection.

### What was actually happening

Two of the nine features were coming out as flat zeros, and both because of
defects in our simulator:

- `growth_rate` was exactly 0.000 for every pyramid because the analysis
  window was taken as the range of the events themselves, and ordinary
  spending drags an account's tail far past the horizon, moving the midpoint.
- `reinvestment_rate` was exactly 0.000 because our investors deposited once
  and never again, which real participants do not.

Both were fixed. Re-run on the current world, the same model, unchanged:

| | first run | after the generator was fixed |
|---|---|---|
| `growth_rate`, pyramids | 0.000 | 1.072 |
| `reinvestment_rate`, pyramids | 0.000 | 0.232 |
| pyramids found at threshold 0.70 | **0 / 30** | **40 / 40** |
| ROC-AUC | 1.0000 | 0.9994 |
| false alarms | 0 / 220 | 12 / 180 |

**We measured a model through a broken instrument and blamed the model.**
Recorded rather than deleted, because the failure mode generalises: a
component that reads flat zeros is far more likely to be badly fed than badly
built, and the first move on seeing one should be to check the feed.

### What is true now, with its own caveat

The model detects the pyramids. It is not, however, a good result yet:
`referral_ratio` reads 0.991 against 0.000 and `structural_depth` 16 against
2, and both separate perfectly for one reason — **no honest population in the
simulation pays referral bonuses**. A legitimate referral-marketing business
would land in exactly that region.

So the current 0.9994 measures a task made artificially easy, and the
original criticism of the model's calibration is neither confirmed nor
refuted: it has not been tested against a fair opponent. Closing that gap is
the open item.

---

## Finding 2b — the original calibration concern, still untested

**Severity: medium. Status: open.**

The nine legacy features were computed from an independent event stream for
the first time — external validation that was structurally impossible while
the generator wrote the features itself.

```
ROC-AUC = 1.0000        looks excellent
Pyramids found: 0 / 30  at the system's own high-risk threshold of 0.70
```

All thirty pyramids scored near **0.50**. The high-risk threshold is **0.70**.
On independent data the model would not have flagged a single pyramid while
ranking them flawlessly.

**AUC 1.0 is compatible with zero detections.** Ranking and decision are
different things; reporting the first while operating on the second is
self-deception. This is the concrete cost of the uncalibrated `predict_proba`
of a random forest.

### Why: the features do not mean what their names say

| Feature | Pyramid | Honest | Reading |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gini_coefficient` | 0.336 | 0.345 | **no signal** — and this carried 34.7 % of the model's importance |
| `centralization_index` | 0.011 | 0.019 | a pyramid with 400 investors has a top-depositor share near 1/400; the model trained on 0.2–0.9 |
| `transaction_entropy` | 5.000 | 4.704 | saturated at the upper bound |
| `structural_depth` | 16.0 | 2.0 | saturated at the upper bound |
| `payout_dependency` | 0.921 | 0.224 | **works** — and carried only 0.04 of importance |
| `avg_holding_time` | 6.0 d | 47.0 d | **works** |

The feature carrying a third of the model's decisions has no signal once
computed from actual money flows: Gini was an artefact of the old generator,
where it was deliberately strengthened by a correlation adjustment. Meanwhile
`payout_dependency` — the literal definition of a Ponzi scheme — was almost
switched off and turns out to be one of the strongest.

**Caveat, stated before anyone asks.** `referral_ratio` (0.991 vs 0.000) and
`structural_depth` (16 vs 2) separate perfectly because no honest population
pays referral bonuses. Until an honest referral-based business exists in the
simulation, the ROC-AUC figure for pyramids must not be quoted as a result.

---

## Finding 3 — the first simulator leaked, and how

**Severity: critical at the time. Status: fixed, documented so it is not
repeated.**

The first version of the event generator produced **ROC-AUC 1.0000** on
account-level features: the previous project's mistake, one storey up.

| Feature | AUC then | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| `account_age_days` | 0.978 | mule accounts opened 3–90 days ago against 60–1500 for everyone else |
| `total_in` | 0.964 | mule amounts 150k–900k against 30k–260k, almost disjoint |
| `transit_median_min` | 0.908 | mule delay 0.5–6 min against 1–40 min |

All three came from defining populations with **uniform intervals**. A uniform
interval gives a hard edge that a model splits on without any meaning behind
it. Replaced by log-normal distributions with heavy overlap, which is also
more realistic: real schemes push whatever the fraud yielded, mules sometimes
withdraw half an hour later, and accounts are often old ones whose access was
bought.

After the fix, against hard negatives: **ROC-AUC 0.9019**, best single feature
0.778. Recorded honestly: the acceptance ceiling is 0.90, so this sits two
thousandths above it and remains a judgement call rather than a passed gate.

Also fixed in the same pass:

- **Pyramid investors were counted as fraudulent accounts.** They are victims.
  Counting them inflated the fraud share threefold.
- **Employers paid on random days per employee.** Real payroll pays everyone
  at once, which is what creates honest fan-out.
- **The analysis window was taken as min/max over all events**, and ordinary
  spending drags the tail far past the horizon, so the midpoint drifted and
  `growth_rate` came out as exactly 0.000 for every pyramid.

## Finding 4 — the case builder leaks the answer

**Severity: critical. Status: ADDRESSED by
`simulation/discovery.py`. Found by the validation methods on the day they
were added, which is what they are for.**

Purged walk-forward CV over case-level features returns **ROC-AUC 1.0000 on
every split**, and naive k-fold returns the same. When the honest and the
leaky protocol agree perfectly, the protocol is not what is wrong — the task
is trivially separable, and something upstream is handing over the answer.

It is `build_cases`. A `mule_network` case is assembled from
`world.networks`, i.e. from the ground-truth file: the twenty accounts that
form the network are grouped for the detector in advance. Payroll and
whip-round cases are built from a single account each. So a fraudulent case
arrives as a twenty-account cluster inside a twelve-minute window and an
honest one arrives as one account, and a classifier separates them on almost
any column.

**A real detector is never handed the grouping.** It has to find candidate
clusters itself and then decide which of them are networks. Defining the
unit of analysis from the answers makes the hardest half of the problem
disappear before modelling starts.

Two consequences visible in the same run:

- The quintile ladder is perfectly monotonic with a spread of +1.000, which
  looks excellent and only confirms the separation is degenerate.
- Permutation importance is **0.0000 for every feature including the
  shuffled control**: with a perfect model and redundant features, permuting
  any single column drops nothing. An importance table full of zeros is a
  symptom of a saturated task, not of unimportant features.

**Fix.** Candidate cases must be built by clustering accounts on shared
resources — the same ATM, the same time window, a common ancestor within k
hops — with no reference to `world.networks`. A candidate then may be a real
network, a payroll, a whip-round or junk, and telling them apart becomes the
measured task. Ground truth is used only to label a candidate after it has
been found, and recall must then be reported over networks the clustering
never proposed.

### Fixed

`discover_candidates` proposes clusters from the event stream alone, linking
accounts that share a resource rather than accounts that pay each other:
the same ATM inside a short window, a common funding ancestor within k hops,
the same tight time window. Union-find over those links gives the candidates.
A test asserts the guarantee directly — stripping every network from the
world does not change a single candidate.

Labels are attached afterwards, and that produces a number the previous
design could not express at all:

```
candidates proposed from events alone   183
real networks                           110
proposed at least once                   96
COVERAGE                              0.873   <- ceiling on recall
never proposed                           14
```

**Coverage is a ceiling no downstream model can lift.** A network no candidate
contains cannot be found however good the classifier is. Under the old design
this number was 1.000 by construction and therefore meaningless.

### The honest candidates were being deleted, not being easy

Measuring what the honest candidates consisted of found the real cause, and
it was not that the task is easy.

Two defects, both in discovery itself:

**The ancestor link used the wrong timestamp.** It attached a link to an
account's most recent activity rather than to the moment money arrived along
that path. Two employees paid by one company on the same payday were
therefore not linked, because their "time" was whichever salary happened to
be their last. Payrolls never became candidates at all.

**One component swallowed the hard half of the task.** Two-hop expansion
passed through hubs, so a single component of **5 398 accounts** formed —
every salary earner, 243 fast spenders, 210 mules, the family circles — and
was then discarded for exceeding the size cap. The confusable populations
were being deleted silently, which is exactly why what remained looked
trivially separable.

Fixed by attaching the link to the arrival time along the path, capping the
fan of an intermediary during expansion, and adding a common-receiver link so
a whip-round (forty people paying one collector) can become a candidate at
all.

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| candidates | 183 | 714 |
| base rate | 0.519 | **0.132** |
| honest candidate size, max | 5 | **104** |
| ROC-AUC, purged walk-forward | 1.0000 | **0.9886** |
| quintile ladder | monotonic, +1.000 | **not monotonic**, +0.645 |

The ladder turning non-monotonic is the informative part: the score separates
but does not order, which a single AUC would have hidden.

### Union-find was the wrong structure, and that was the last cause

The blob survived every parameter fix because the clustering primitive itself
was wrong. Union-find is transitive: one coincidental link merges two
clusters permanently and nothing can un-merge them. A single component of
4 531 accounts still formed, holding every salary earner, 210 mules and 203
fast spenders, and was discarded whole for exceeding the size cap.

Replaced by a **weighted link graph with corroboration**: every shared
resource adds weight to an edge, links resting on one thin coincidence are
pruned, and communities are extracted by modularity rather than by transitive
closure. One shared resource is a coincidence; several independent ones are a
signal.

| | union-find | weighted + corroboration |
|---|---|---|
| candidates | 714 | 225 |
| base rate | 0.132 | 0.489 |
| **coverage** | 0.864 | **1.000** |
| salary earners in candidates | 0 | **371** |
| honest size, min/median/max | 3/3/104 | **3/8/84** |

Coverage reaching 1.000 means the 15 networks previously lost were inside the
discarded blob. Payrolls — the honest structure that most resembles a ring's
fan-out — are finally represented.

**Corroboration does the separating, not the community detection.** Measured
across Louvain resolutions 0.8 to 1.4 on the full world: candidate set, base
rate, coverage and size distribution are byte-identical at every value. The
resolution is left neutral, and modularity remains only as a safety net for a
bridge that pruning misses.

### What the remaining ROC-AUC of 1.0000 actually means

With discovery clean, coverage complete and both classes comparable in size,
classification still separates perfectly. That is no longer a discovery
artefact — it is a property of the simulator.

**Our mules do exactly one thing:** receive money and cash it out. Real mules
are real people who also draw a salary, buy groceries, and sometimes do not
cash out at all. A ring made only of single-purpose accounts is structurally
unambiguous, so a perfect score here measures how clean our fraud is, not how
good the detector is.

### Fixed: mules now have ordinary lives

A mule is a person, not an account that exists to be a mule. Three quarters
of them now draw a wage and spend it like anybody else, so the ring's events
sit inside an ordinary history rather than being the whole of it. Exit
behaviour varies: 15 % relay the money onward to another member instead of
touching a machine, 20 % take only part of it and spend the remainder
normally, the rest cash out in full.

| | single-purpose mules | mules with lives |
|---|---|---|
| ROC-AUC, purged walk-forward | 1.0000 | **0.8111** |
| PR-AUC | 1.0000 | **0.7087** |
| coverage | 1.000 | 0.945 |
| honest candidate size, median | 8 | 12 |
| quintile ladder | monotonic, +1.000 | **not monotonic**, +0.615 |

**0.8111 is the first honest baseline this project has produced.** Everything
measured before it was measuring the simulator rather than the detector.

Two observations came with it.

**The obvious rule flags honest people more often than mules.** The
fast-cash-out rule now catches 96 % of students who withdraw their money at
once, 80 % of marketplace sellers, and **40 % of mules**. Anyone writing the
first rule that comes to mind would produce a system that is worse than
useless — it points away from the fraud. This is now pinned as an acceptance
check rather than left as an anecdote.

**The top quintile is not the most fraudulent.** The ladder reads 0.00, 0.23,
0.85, 0.69, 0.62: the score separates but inverts at the top. A single AUC
would have hidden that completely, which is the whole reason the ladder was
added.

One gap left open: `burst_ratio_90s` alone scores 0.9944 in-sample while the
full model scores 0.8111 out-of-sample under purged walk-forward. The two are
not directly comparable, but a gap that size says the time split is doing
real work — periods differ, and a feature that separates over the whole
dataset does not carry forward. Worth a dedicated experiment before any
feature is called strong.


### The baseline is now reproducible, and the archived one is not

The figure of 0.8111 above was produced in a working session and survived
only as prose: no committed code re-derived it. That is the same defect class
as the rest of this document one level up — a number a reader cannot check.

`ml/case_pipeline.py` is the missing path (world → discovery → features from
events → purged walk-forward), and `scripts/case_baseline.py` runs it end to
end. On the default configuration, seed 42:

```
candidates            97
of them networks      19
base rate             0.1959
COVERAGE              1.0000
ROC-AUC (out-of-fold) 0.9095
PR-AUC                0.8899
scored folds          3 of 5
quintile ladder       NOT monotonic, spread +1.000, rank correlation +0.887
```

**These are not the archived numbers, and the difference is not explained.**
The archive records 225 candidates at base rate 0.489 and coverage 0.945;
committed code gives 97 at 0.196 and 1.000. Discovery has not changed since
that entry was written, so the likely cause is that the archived run used
parameters or a world that were never committed. Until that is resolved, the
figures in this block are the ones to quote, because they are the ones anyone
can reproduce.

Two things in the run deserve their own line.

**Only three of five folds could be scored.** The purge starves the earliest
folds of positives, so the pooled AUC rests on 45 test rows holding 19
networks in total. That is a thin measurement and must not be presented as a
settled one.

**Two features separate backwards.** `graph_density` reads 0.065 and
`graph_fanout_share` 0.041 as single-feature AUCs — far below 0.5, which
means fraudulent candidates have *lower* values than honest ones. Honest
candidates in this world are payrolls and whip-rounds, and a payroll is
precisely a dense fan-out. The features work; the sign is the opposite of
what their names suggest, and a reader shown only "AUC 0.04" would conclude
they were broken.

---

## Finding 5 — the headline feature does not transfer to real data

**Severity: high. Status: reported, not fixed. This is a negative result and
it stands.**

`graph_relay_share` was tested against the Elliptic Bitcoin dataset — 203 769
real transaction nodes, 234 355 edges, 46 564 labelled (4 545 illicit). It is
the only public dataset combining real transactions, real fraud labels and
graph structure.

Balanced sample of 2 400 labelled nodes, two-hop neighbourhood per node:

| Feature | AUC on real data |
|---|---|
| `hub_share` | 0.615 |
| `density` | 0.549 |
| `fanout_share` | 0.529 |
| **`relay_share`** | **0.515** |
| `reciprocity` | 0.500 |

On the simulator the same feature separates mule networks from everything
else completely. On real labelled fraud it is barely above a coin flip. Only
convergence (`hub_share`) carries anything, and weakly.

### Ruling out the obvious explanation

Elliptic exposes no amounts, so the test had to use a counting version of the
feature rather than the value-weighted one. That is an obvious candidate
explanation, and it is wrong. Running both versions on simulated data:

```
relay_share, value-weighted : AUC 1.0000
relay_share, unweighted     : AUC 1.0000
```

The counting version loses nothing. **Missing amounts do not explain the
failure.**

### What remains, and what cannot be separated

Two explanations survive, and the available data cannot distinguish them:

1. **Different graph semantics.** Elliptic nodes are *transactions*, not
   accounts. In Bitcoin's UTXO model every transaction consumes inputs and
   produces outputs, so relaying is what the graph is made of rather than a
   distinguishing shape.
2. **Different fraud.** Elliptic's illicit class is ransomware, darknet
   markets and scams. None of them is a source → mules → ATM cash-out, which
   is the structure the feature encodes.

Separating these needs an account-level labelled graph, and no public one
exists.

### What may and may not be claimed

- **May:** the feature separates in simulation; the transfer test was run;
  it did not transfer; the missing-amounts explanation is excluded.
- **May not:** that the feature works on real banking data. It has not been
  shown, and the one available check came back negative.

Reporting this is not a setback to manage. A project whose only evidence is
its own simulator and which never attempted an external check is weaker than
one that attempted it and reports a null result with the reason.

**Note on the simulated figure.** The AUC of 1.0000 quoted above for our own
data is itself inflated by Finding 4 — the case builder groups accounts using
the ground-truth file. Until that is fixed, "it works in simulation" is a
weaker claim than the number suggests, and the two findings must be read
together.


## What is still open

1. An honest referral-based business, so `referral_ratio` stops separating for
   free (blocks any pyramid figure being quoted).
2. **Training the sequence and graph branches on event-derived matrices.**
   `engine_v2` already reads real events at inference time, but the graph and
   sequence models were fitted on `build_*_matrix_from_tabular`, so the
   service runs both branches as heuristic proxies. The interface says so on
   screen; the fix is to retrain on `build_*_matrix_from_events`.
3. Retraining and calibrating the legacy model on flow-derived features.
4. **Reconciling the archived case-level numbers with the reproducible ones**
   (Finding 4), or withdrawing the archived ones.
5. The evasion sweep and the detectability curve.
6. An account-level labelled graph, if one can be obtained, to separate the
   two surviving explanations in Finding 5.
